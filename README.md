Creating a recommendation system for movies using NLP with a dataset containing users, movies, ratings, tags, genres, titles, and dates is certainly possible and can lead to a robust and nuanced system. Let's break down how you might approach this:

2. Precision@k
3. Recall@k
4. Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)


Now, let's dive into how you could build this system:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Preprocess all text data (titles, tags, genres) using NLP techniques like tokenization, removing stop words, and lemmatization.
   - Convert dates into useful features (e.g., year, month, day of week).
   - Encode categorical data like genres and users.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Use word embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe) to convert movie titles and tags into dense vector representations.
   - Apply topic modeling (e.g., LDA) on tags and titles to extract latent topics.
   - Perform sentiment analysis on tags to get sentiment scores.

3. Collaborative Filtering Component:
   - Use matrix factorization or neural collaborative filtering to learn latent representations of users and movies based on ratings.

4. Content-Based Filtering Component:
   - Create a content-based model using the NLP-processed features (embeddings of titles, tags, genres, sentiment scores, topics).

5. Hybrid Model:
   - Combine the collaborative and content-based components. This could be done by:
     a) Concatenating the latent factors from collaborative filtering with the content-based features.
     b) Using separate neural networks for collaborative and content components, then combining their outputs.

6. Neural Network Architecture:
   - Input Layer: User features, movie features (including NLP-derived features).
   - Embedding Layers: For categorical features like user IDs and movie IDs.
   - Hidden Layers: Dense layers with appropriate activations (e.g., ReLU).
   - Attention Mechanism: To weigh the importance of different features.
   - Output Layer: Predicted rating or recommendation score.

7. Training:
   - Use a suitable loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error for ratings prediction).
   - Employ techniques like batch normalization, dropout for regularization.
   - Use appropriate optimizers like Adam.

8. Time-Aware Recommendations:
   - Incorporate the date information to capture temporal dynamics.
   - You could use techniques like time decay to give more weight to recent ratings.

9. Cold Start Handling:
   - For new users or movies, rely more heavily on the content-based part of your model.

10. Evaluation:
    - Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) for rating prediction.
    - For ranking tasks, use metrics like Precision@k, Recall@k, NDCG.

This approach leverages NLP to extract rich features from textual data (titles, tags, genres) while also incorporating collaborative information from user-movie interactions. The hybrid nature of the system allows it to provide nuanced recommendations based on both content similarity and user behavior patterns.
